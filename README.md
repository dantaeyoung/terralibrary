## philosophy

- screens are horrible because they demand visual and thus cognitive attention; they lock you into a place and orientation
- paper is lovely because it moves around in space, has spatial affordances, and thus participates in psychospatial life; you can hide tuck fold unfold file page glue stick pin crumple paper
- audio is somatically freeing because your body can be in any position and you can still listen
- barcode scanners are like magic wands: they engage the body, and it's clear to everyone else what you're doing when you point, too
- the spoken word is clear
