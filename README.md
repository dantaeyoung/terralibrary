# terralibrary

computers are magic.

screens are horrible.

paper is lovely.

books are beautiful.

*terralibrary is a magic computer for a beautiful library that doesn't need a screen to use.*

## what

- a magic wand (barcode reader)
- a magic brain (raspberry pi)
- a magic mouth (a usb speaker)
- a magic scroll (receipt printer)

## inspo

- [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/)
- [Hypercard In The World](https://tashian.com/articles/dynamicland/)
- [ELECTRONICOS FANTASTICOS!](https://www.electronicosfantasticos.com/)

## setup

Check out [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

## arguments

- screens are horrible because they demand visual and thus cognitive attention; they lock you into a place and bodily orientation
- paper is lovely because it moves around in space, has spatial affordances, and thus participates in psychospatial life; you can hide tuck fold unfold file page glue stick pin crumple paper
  -  see: "the myth of the paperless office"
- audio is somatically freeing because your body can be in any position and you can still listen; others can listen, too
- barcode scanners are like magic wands: they engage the body, and it's clear to everyone else what you're doing when you point, too
- the spoken word is clear
- computers should be weird

## philosophy
- **everything should be hackable.** this is a programming language - not just a series of buttons, but a truly hackable system that you might be able to mess up
- **let the physical world keep things mysterious.** anything to do with secrecy or authentication should happen through paper. (printed qr code as password, checksum match in order to login)
- **screens do not scroll.** scrolling is a disassociative abomination. text that doesn't fit shrinks to fit the screen.
- **this is not a novelty, but part of real life.** I want to use this on a regular basis; for it to be really meaningful.

## ideas
- [ ] web interface for editing & printing chunks of code. like dynamicland's wall of code.
